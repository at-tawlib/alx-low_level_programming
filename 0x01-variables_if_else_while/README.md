# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

**0-positive_or_negative.c** : assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed, and check if it is `positive`, `zero` or `negative`

**1-last_digit.c** : assign a random number to the variable `n` and check if it is greater or less or equal to some value

**2-print_alphabet.c** : prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar`

**3-print_alphabets.c** : prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase using `putchar`

**4-print_alphabt.c** : prints the alphabet in lowercase, except `q` and `e` using `putchar`

**5-print_numbers.c** : prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`

**6-print_numberz.c** : prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` using only `putchar` at least twice

**7-print_tebahpla.c** : prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, using `putchar`

**8-print_base16.c** : prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, using `putchar`

**9-print_comb.c** : prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using `putchar`

**100-print_comb3.c** : prints all possible different combinations of two digits with some rules:
-   Numbers must be separated by  `,`, followed by a space
-   The two digits must be different
-   `01`  and  `10`  are considered the same combination of the two digits  `0`  and  `1`
-   Print only the smallest combination of two digits
-   Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
-   You can only use the  `putchar`  function (every other function (`printf`,  `puts`, etc…) is forbidden)
-   You can only use  `putchar`  five times maximum in your code
-   You are not allowed to use any variable of type  `char`
-   All your code should be in the  `main`  function 

**101-print_comb4.c** : prints all possible different combinations of three digits
-   Numbers must be separated by  `,`, followed by a space
-   The three digits must be different
-   `012`,  `120`,  `102`,  `021`,  `201`,  `210`  are considered the same combination of the three digits  `0`,  `1`  and  `2`
-   Print only the smallest combination of three digits
-   Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
-   You can only use the  `putchar`  function (every other function (`printf`,  `puts`, etc…) is forbidden)
-   You can only use  `putchar`  six times maximum in your code
-   You are not allowed to use any variable of type  `char`
-   All your code should be in the  `main`  function

**102-print_comb5.c** : prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
-   The numbers should range from  `0`  to  `99`
-   The two numbers should be separated by a space
-   All numbers should be printed with two digits.  `1`  should be printed as  `01`
-   The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
-   The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
-   `00 01`  and  `01 00`  are considered as the same combination of the numbers  `0`  and  `1`
-   You can only use the  `putchar`  function (every other function (`printf`,  `puts`, etc…) is forbidden)
-   You can only use  `putchar`  eight times maximum in your code
-   You are not allowed to use any variable of type  `char`
-   All your code should be in the  `main`  function
