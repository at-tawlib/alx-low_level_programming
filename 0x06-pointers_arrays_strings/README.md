# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

**0-strcat.c** : function that concatenates two strings

**1-strncat.c** : function that concatenates two strings of `n` bytes

**2-strncpy.c** : function that copies a string without using the standard libraries. 
>Works exactly like `strncpy`

**101-print_number_old.c** : just like the above but does not use while loop and can't be used for very large numbers
