# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

**0-strcat.c** : function that concatenates two strings

**1-strncat.c** : function that concatenates two strings of `n` bytes

**2-strncpy.c** : function that copies a string without using the standard libraries. 
>Works exactly like `strncpy`

**3-strcmp.c** : compares two strings withoud using standard libraries. 
>Works exactly like `strcmp`

**4-rev_array.c**: reverses the content of an array of integers

**5-string_toupper.c** : changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

**6-cap_string.c** : capitalizes all words of a string.

**7-leet.c** : encodes a string to `1337`
- `a` and `A` replaced by `4`
- `e` and `E` replaced by `3`
- `o` and `O` replaced by `0`
- `t` and `T` replaced by `7`
- `l` and `L` replaced by `1`

**100-rot13.c** : encodes a string using [rot13](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/YRxmNA7BnP6yZhl09TKX3A "rot13").

**101-print_number.c** : prints an integer using only `_putchar()`

**101-print_number_old.c** : just like the above but does not use while loop and can't be used for very large numbers
