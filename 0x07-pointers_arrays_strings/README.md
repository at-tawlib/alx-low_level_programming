# 0x07.C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

**0-memset.c** : function fills the first `n` bytes of the memory are pointed to by `s` with constant byte `b` and returns a pointer to the memory area `s` (works like the `memset` function of the standard library

**1-memcpy.c** : copies bytes from memory area to destination and returns pointer to destination. (Works like the `memcpy()` function).

**2-strchr.c** : returns a pointer to the first occurance of a character in the string given or `NULL` is character is not found

**3-strspn.c** : function that gets the length of a prefix substring

**4-strpbrk.c** : searches a string for any of a set of bytes

**5-strstr.c** : locates a substring in a string

**7-print_chessboard.c** : prints a chessboard

**8-print_diagsums.c** : prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
